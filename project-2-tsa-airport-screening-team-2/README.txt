To compile and execute, run the 'run.bat' file included. It is assumed that you have java
set as a path variable, and maven installed on your system.

To change variables around, go into Main.java and you can change the values
of "numLines" to increase/decrease the number of lines. By changing "numPassengers" 
you can change the number of passengers that get through the system.
