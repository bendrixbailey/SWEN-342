This program was built in visual studio code. It was compiled and run by vs code. The main() 
method resides in App.java, and all the source files are within the Models directory. Simply compile
the App.java file, and run it, and the program should work as expected.


This program needs to only be started, and has no configurable variables. Most of the random things are
pre-defined with their boundaries, and the java random generator creates enough variablility. Some things,
like the barriers, require a set number of devs, team leads, and managers, so flexibility is not allowed

The main app is run with App.java, which has a run method. This starts the entire program.
